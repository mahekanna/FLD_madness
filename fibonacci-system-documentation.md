# Enhanced Fibonacci Market Cycle Trading System

The Fibonacci Market Cycle Trading System is a comprehensive trading platform built around the discovery of universal Fibonacci-based market cycles that remain consistent across different timeframes and instruments. The system detects dominant cycles (particularly 20/21 and 34 periods) that follow the Golden Ratio relationship (1.618) and uses Future Lines of Demarcation (FLDs) to generate precise entry and exit signals.
